Human language is more than just information. Language reflects the way we think and feel.
At scale, this potentially allows us to model both the world we live in and intelligence itself.
I want to understand and expand the intersection between language modeling, vision, reasoning, planning, and interacting with the real world.
Simple is always better than complex, and I think the convergence of deep learning to Transformers is a good example.

Currently, I am a PhD student at UMass Lowell, advised by Prof. Anna Rumshisky.
